/*
The most basic of all data structures, an array stores data in memory for later use. Each array has a fixed number of cells decided on its creation, and each cell has a corresponding numeric index used to select its data. Whenever youâ€™d like to use the array, all you need are the desired indices, and you can access any of the data within.
